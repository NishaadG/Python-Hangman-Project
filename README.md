This Hangman Game is a Python-based GUI application built using Tkinter for the interface and Pillow for displaying dynamic JPG images of the hangman figure. Players guess letters to reveal a randomly chosen word fetched from an online Random Word API, with incorrect guesses causing parts of the hangman to appear on the right side of the screen. The left side displays the word status, tries left, letter buttons, and a reset option. The project follows OOP principles to organize logic and UI components, creating an interactive and visually engaging user experience.
